The code are in the folder `(2) code`, you may need to change the directory macro `%let` in the beginning to read the data successfully.  
You will process the data step by step as described below:
1) Clean the data in `(1) input` folder    
2) Perform one-way ANOVA tests between emotionality and another factor such as gender, ethnicity, etc.

4) Can you give suggestions on controlling youth emotionality and youth violence rate as well?
