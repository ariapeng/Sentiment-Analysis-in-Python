You will process the data step by step as described below:
1) Clean the data in `(1) input` folder using code in `(2) code`. You may need to change the directory to your own      
2) Perform one-way ANOVA tests between emotionality and another factor such as gender, ethnicity, etc.  
3) Conclude correlation and output reports, the reports are saved in the `(3) output` folder
4) Can you give suggestions on controlling youth emotionality and youth violence rate as well?

You can also refer to my stepwise-detailed notes named `Peng_Notes`. Please comment if you have any questions or suggestions.  
  
Thank you.
