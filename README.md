The code are in the folder `(2) code`, you may need to change the directory macro `%let` in the beginning to read the data successfully.  
You will process the data step by step as described below:
1) Clean the data  
2) Perform one-way ANOVA tests between emotionality and another factor such as gender, ethnicity, etc.  
3) Conclude correlation and output reports
4) Can you give suggestions on controlling youth emotionality and youth violence rate as well?
